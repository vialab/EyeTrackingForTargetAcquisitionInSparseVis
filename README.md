# In this paper, we present a novel marker-free method for identifying screens of interest when using head-mounted eye tracking for visualization in cluttered and multi-screen environments. We offer a solution to discerning visualization entities from sparse backgrounds by incorporating edge-detection into the existing pipeline. Our system allows for both more efficient screen identification and improved accuracy over the state-of-the-art ORB algorithm.
